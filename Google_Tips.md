# Using Google with Style
A few tricks, available in Google info page, to use Google in a quite efficient way.
* **Quotation Marks:** When using quotation marks with a set of words, google
will search for the specific set of words.
* **Exclude Terms:** When using a **-** before a term, the query will exclude said word.
For example, *jaguar -animal* would reduce the search to the jaguar vehicle.
* **Find Synonyms:**  When using a **~** before a term, the query will include
synonyms of said term.
* **Site Query** Using the structure **query site:desired_site**, the specified query will be done in the specified site.
* **Link Query:** Using the structure **query link:desired_site**, the specified query will be done in whatever sites contain a link to the desired link.
* **Two-Dots:** When using two dots between numbers, it specifies a range of query for amounts.
* **Related Query:** When using the structure **query related:desired_site**, the
search is done in sites related to the desired site.
* **File Type Specification:**  When using the structure **query filetype:desired_format**,
the search filters only the files that match the desired file type.
